# NeMo v0.7.XXX
High-performance spiking neural network simulator

NeMo is a high-performance spiking neural network simulator
which simulates networks of Izhikevich neurons on CUDA-
enabled GPUs. With high-end NVIDIA graphics cards, NeMo can 
achieve real-time simulation of 500.000s of realistically
connected spiking neurons. NeMo is a C++ class library, 
with additional interfaces for pure C, Python, and Matlab.
